# Cocoa-Percentage-vs-Rating
Using Machine Learning and Analysis to determine the relationship between the cocoa percentage of a type of chocolate and its objective rating.

## Introduction

A universally popular treat, chocolate is available in a variety of forms ranging from beverages, pastries, ice creams, and of course, the standard chocolate bar. In the United States alone, an estimated average of 2.8 billion pounds of chocolate are consumed each year! Milk chocolate is the American fan favorite, with a usual cacao percentage range of 10-55%, followed by Dark Chocolate, with a cacao percentage of at least 55% and above. Between these two popular types of chocolate, cacao percentage helps distinguish the sweeter and lighter tastes of the Milk Chocolate from the richer, more bittersweet taste of Dark Chocolate. Simply put, cacao percentage is the ratio between actual cacao product from cacao butter, liquor, and powder and filler ingredients like vanilla, milk, and other added flavors. Generally, a higher cacao percentage denotes a more intense taste and higher price point, implying that it is of higher quality. Given this information, is it fair to say that higher quality chocolate yields higher ratings? Our study explored whether cacao percentage has a large influence on chocolate ratings in addition to using cacao percentage as a predictor for such chocolate ratings.

### Thesis

While higher cacao percentage is predicted to lead to a lower chocolate rating, there does not appear to be a strong relationship between those two variables.

## Background

### Dataset Information

This dataset includes 2,600 ratings of plain (non-flavored) chocolate bars produced by chocolate manufacturers around the world. The ratings are conducted by the Manhattan Chocolate society, who conduct research on chocolate production in order to produce innovative, high quality chocolate.

In the original Chocolate dataset, 7 variables are mentioned: REF (manufacturing number), Company (Manufacturer) Name, Company Location, Review Date, Country of Bean Origin, Specific Bean Origin or Bar Name, Cacao Percentage, Ingredients, Most Memorable Characteristics, and Rating. For the purposes of our study, we will consider 2 of the 7 variables: **Cacao Percentage, and Rating.**
